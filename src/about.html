                Hi, I'm Nayeon! It's pronounced like nylon without the "l". My name isn't spelled like it would sound, so I hope that's helpful ðŸ˜…. I was born in South Korea and immigrated to the US when I was six years old. I grew up in the Imperial Valley, a small city at the southest corner of California -- right by the border. I moved to Los Angeles for college and have lived here since.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently work full-time as a Senior Lecturer at the <a href="https://itp.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Viterbi School of Engineering</a> at USC. I teach web development to students of all majors. I love it because I think web development is a skill that is so useful no matter what career path you choose. USC is also my alma mater. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science from USC. It was not an easy path, but I'm so glad I persevered through it.  
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">Before teaching, I worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.space150.com/" target="_blank">space150</a>, a creative agency where I worked on web applications for major brands like Disney, Fox, and Nike. Even though I now teach full-time, I still consult and develop projects on the side to keep my feet wet in the latest web technologies. You can check out the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page to see some more details of what I've worked on recently.</p>

                For fun I've been getting into camping and exploring the outdoors with my husband. We recently purchased a rooftop tent so that we can pick up and travel whenever!
