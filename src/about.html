            <p class="mb-4">Hi, I'm Nayeon! It's pronounced like nylon without the "l". My name is spelled weird so I hope that's helpful ðŸ˜…. I currently teach web development full time as a Senior Lecturer at the <a href="https://itp.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Viterbi School of Engineering</a>. I was also once a student at USC -- I got my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at USC.

            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">Before teaching, I worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.space150.com/" target="_blank">space150</a>, a creative agency where I worked on web applications for major brands like Disney, Fox, and Nike. I still consult and develop projects on the side to keep my feet wet in the latest industry standards.</p>

                I was born in South Korea but grew up in a small town called El Centro, located in the Imperial Valley, which is about 4 hours southeast of Los Angeles (past Palm Springs, past Indio).

                For fun I've getting into camping and exploring the outdoors with my husband. We recently purchased a rooftop tent so that we can pick up and travel whenever!
