=========

Source code of my personal website, nayeon.kim.

Built with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindcss</a>. Trying out tailwind for the first time!

To run the code 
1. Install Tailwind CSS

```
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

2. Start the Tailwind CLI build process by running the following command in command line:

```
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```

Note the actual CSS file is built and saved in the `dist` folder.
